Li Hou joined the Li Lab as a postdoctoral fellow in 2025. She gained her Ph.D. from the Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), where she specialized in investigating the roles of small non-coding RNAs in mammalian oocytes. During her doctoral training, she developed extensive expertise in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and spatial transcriptomics. In her current research, Li Hou focuses on deciphering the regulatory mechanisms of DNA methylation in developmental processes and disease pathogenesis. Additionally, she is pioneering novel methodologies to elucidate the spatial dynamics of DNA methylation regulation across diverse biological contexts.
