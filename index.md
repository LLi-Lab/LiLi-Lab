# Welcome to the Li Lab!
 
Cell fate choice is a fundamental biological question, which is involved in tissue development, aging and cancer progression. A central interest of the Li lab is to understand how genetic and epigenetic regulators as well as cell niche interplay with each other, and how they collectively regulate cell identity and cell dynamics. To achieve this, we are developing cutting-edge tools to record and decode cell fate choice. We hope the knowledge that we generate can contribute to tissue regeneration and curing disease.
