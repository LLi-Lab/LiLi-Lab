# Welcome to the Wang Lab!

We are affiliated with both [School of Life Sciences](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/shouwen-wang.html) and the [Physics Department](https://westlake.edu.cn/faculty/shouwen-wang.html) in Westlake University. We are dedicated to developing novel computational approaches for single-cell genomics, particularly for single-cell lineage tracing. A major focus of the lab will be to integrate single-cell lineage, transcriptome, and epigenome measurements to further understand biological phenomena at different scales, such as cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis. 
 
 We closely collaborate with other experimental groups, integrate cutting-edge experimental designs and data collection for lineage tracing, and draw inspiration from fields such as statistical physics, computer science, and applied mathematics for modeling and data analysis.
